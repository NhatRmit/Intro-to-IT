         I come from Viet Nam so I am Vietnamese. But I wish that one day I can have another nationality is English.
         It is a dream and it does not cost any price so I just dream about.
         Then, just a little bit about myself that I want to write down that is I am not an introvert.\n
         I am lazy whenever nothing can interest me to do but as soon as I like it, I spend all the time for it, days and nights.\n
         I like playing badminton and soccer, but do not have time and partners to play with, I can be in any group and type of people.\n

    <h1 style="color: red">Interest in IT</h1>
    <div>
      <p>There is a long story for me to absolutely studying Information of Technology. First of all, the fact that I really love Technology
         thus, since I was in grade 11th, I wished that someday I could create something innovative just like Apple or Microsoft.
         First it was a dream, then my brother said that IT is one the most difficult major which students graduate very few.
         At that moment, I was scared, I listened to my parents to apply into Hospitality in RMIT. Right there, after two semesters studying
         , I had found myself getting bored because of business. It was like a destiny that I found Daniel Shiffman who teaches JS, HTML, CSS, ect,..
         I was admired him and starting learning code from him and Processing was the first application which I wrote down my first code.
         Now, here I am, I am going to a Junior then farthur due to learning all courses in RMIT. I am wondering that RMIT or me or could be both
         will help me to be good at using code to help people.

    <h1 style="color: red">Ideal Job</h1>

          <img src="" alt="">
          <a href="https://itviec.com/it-jobs/game-developer-mecury-studio-3709"></a>
          I wish someday I will be in a team together creating games with everyone. Within my basic knowledge about C# and OOP, I want to challenge myself in
          reality, in society. Then, I found an advertisement recruiting a developer for mobile games. I am in love with this position enormously, because
          as it said, this position requires candidates to have knowledge in C# and Javascript basically and also have experience in working with Unity.
          More importantly, they need candidates to have at least 2 games published in many platforms. In my opinion, except the actual games which I still have
          not made any yet, I have confidence in myself in other requirements that I am enough to reach this position. But unfortunately, I am still undergraduation.
          So that, I miss this chance to apply, maybe far in future, they still recruit. This job will give me a chance to work in an international environment because
          it is from Singapore which means chance to fly to Singapore is bigger than usual.

    <h1 style="color: red">Project Ideas</h1>
    <div>
      <p>
              <h3 style="color: blue">Overview</h3><br>
              The project called "Han and the way back home". This project is an Indie game using less and simple tools
              that only one person is able to make it without teams to support. It is not going to be hard
              in the gameplay, besides, it is going to focus on the content, graphics and also the sound to attract those
              who want to enjoy game as the movie more than how it played. The project is inspired by the game called
              "Ori and the Blind Forest". However, that game is good at all such as gameplay, plot, music and also graphics.
              The game is about an adventure of Han finding way back home. It is actually about the dog, Han is his name.
<br>
              <h3 style="color: blue">Motivation</h3><br>
              I believe that my game will be played and responsed by many people because it is about the smart of
              how dog can find their way back to home whenever incidentally lost by their boss.
              It is not about fighting and not having violent scenes that could make someone hate it because of the way dogs being treated.
              It is going to have tactic and using brain to pass obstacles in game more than killing it or super power to pass it.
              Lastly, the dog character is not only one, you will have many choices of many popular types of dogs.

<br>
              <h3 style="color: blue">Skills Required</h3><br>
              As I mentioned above, this game/project is the Indie game which is the type of game that only one person can make it
              without anyone to help. However, that person needs at least some skills in basics to let the work easier and faster.
              In this game, specifically, does not have to be an expert. It needs a programmer who knows to write code, one who knows
              to create graphics and design it, a designer. A content creator to create the wonderful or at least meaningful story
              through the game. Lastly, the one who can search approriate music for game or compose music. In this case, the game does
              not need to be perfect in using any software, if they know the basics, it takes long time than usual.
<br>
              <h3 style="color: blue">Outcome</h3><br>
              If this project could be made in the future and fortunately, it is successful in the market that means my project can make money.
              Then, I can reach my thoughts to everyone. Importantly, I have something to interest all the company about the game I have made
              and it is not just made, it is played by many people. Moreover, for those who interested in this game will understand how hard
              and misereble dogs are whenever they lost their boss. This will make people love their dogs and more careful than before.
              This also means that the society or just a small community who played this game will be more careful in protecting their dogs from bad people.
              Moreover, for the developers, part one is successful which means part two is going to be in process. It is a good point.
