      <p>There is a long story for me to absolutely studying Information of Technology. First of all, the fact that I really love Technology
         thus, since I was in grade 11th, I wished that someday I could create something innovative just like Apple or Microsoft.
         First it was a dream, then my brother said that IT is one the most difficult major which students graduate very few.
         At that moment, I was scared, I listened to my parents to apply into Hospitality in RMIT. Right there, after two semesters studying
         , I had found myself getting bored because of business. It was like a destiny that I found Daniel Shiffman who teaches JS, HTML, CSS, ect,..
         I was admired him and starting learning code from him and Processing was the first application which I wrote down my first code.
         Now, here I am, I am going to a Junior then farthur due to learning all courses in RMIT. I am wondering that RMIT or me or could be both
         will help me to be good at using code to help people.

          I wish someday I will be in a team together creating games with everyone. Within my basic knowledge about C# and OOP, I want to challenge myself in
          reality, in society. Then, I found an advertisement recruiting a developer for mobile games. I am in love with this position enormously, because
          as it said, this position requires candidates to have knowledge in C# and Javascript basically and also have experience in working with Unity.
          More importantly, they need candidates to have at least 2 games published in many platforms. In my opinion, except the actual games which I still have
          not made any yet, I have confidence in myself in other requirements that I am enough to reach this position. But unfortunately, I am still undergraduation.
          So that, I miss this chance to apply, maybe far in future, they still recruit. This job will give me a chance to work in an international environment because
          it is from Singapore which means chance to fly to Singapore is bigger than usual.

        When I tested online application on browser about my personality and my learning style, I have recognized that there are a lot of things about myself which I do not
        know about it until they analyze for me. Firstly, it is the 16Personalities testing my traits and the result is definitely surprise me. I always tell everyone that I am
        an introvert, but it is not. The result in general is telling me that I am very energetic in everything and working with feelings, following my heart more than following
        my head, my brains. I am quite worried about this part of mine. I know that I am judging everything by my feelings but some time just follow my heart only hurt myself and
        my life. Fortunately, I have not done anything which makes me disappointed yet. Moreover, this test will explain reasonably why I am a tactile/kinesthetic.
        This style of learning is about combining movements and studyings altogether to imagine how the study will flow in my brains. The first test from 16Personalities also explain
        for my last test from Big Five, the in the OCEAN, I am most of the A which means Agreeableness. It means a person with high A will trust their people, always care about others
        explaining how sympathetic I am which means how I am working with feelings more than logics.

              <h2 style="color: blue">Overview</h2><br>
              The project called "Han and the way back home". This project is an Indie game using less and simple tools
              that only one person is able to make it without teams to support. It is not going to be hard
              in the gameplay, besides, it is going to focus on the content, graphics and also the sound to attract those
              who want to enjoy game as the movie more than how it played. The project is inspired by the game called
              "Ori and the Blind Forest". However, that game is good at all such as gameplay, plot, music and also graphics.
              The game is about an adventure of Han finding way back home. It is actually about the dog, Han is his name.
      </p>
      <p>
              <h2 style="color: blue">Motivation</h2><br>
              I believe that my game will be played and responsed by many people because it is about the smart of
              how dog can find their way back to home whenever incidentally lost by their boss.
              It is not about fighting and not having violent scenes that could make someone hate it because of the way dogs being treated.
              It is going to have tactic and using brain to pass obstacles in game more than killing it or super power to pass it.
              Lastly, the dog character is not only one, you will have many choices of many popular types of dogs.
      </p>
      <p>
              <h2 style="color: blue">Description</h2><br>
              There are some features of this game are able to attract fans of Indie games. One of those is the content, which is one of the kind.
              Because as far as I have known, there is no such a game talking about pets. "Han and the way back home" will show you all the obstacles
              that an ordinary dog can suffer whenever it is lost their boss or lost the way coming home. Particularly, the game will show players all
              emotions and feelings showing on the dog's face how they feel exact like in the reality. Especially, dogs have feelings and characteristics like
              human, thus, the game is supposed to develop Han's feelings and emotions during the games, from "a little boy" of his boss, to an actual "man".
              Then the game is going to require players to use their brains more than their hands on keyboard. Cause all the hurdles are about trick
              questions and you need to pass it smartly. Depending on how you pass the first trial, the second will be more difficult than the previous.
              For instance, being caught by the group of people who want to sell dogs for butchers, being kidnapped by those who hate dogs and want to punish them.
              I want to remind that there will not be blood, the dog is just being caught and it will find the way out. However, time will be limited and
              when it is over, game will be stopped. Guaranteely, there will not have blood. Time limitation combine with the rushing music will be the best
              feature of this game. Due to the first Indie game having time limitation. Most of the game only has timing to pass the hurdles like "Limbo" or "Inside".
              Eventhough the game is about a dog and his name is Han, the player is able to create their own dogs and also cats. Then they can experience the game in
              the hardest mode like exactly in reality and all the situations will not be the same orders. Specially, gameplay is not complicated, there are four movements,
              jump, walking slowly, lying, and hold the breath controls, game is not using the mouse to play. Sounds and audios will not let players disappointed by making players get through their feelings from nervous to excited and from peaceful to hateful, angry and then
              sympathy. Furthermore, eventhough it is only an Indie game, it is made very carefully with all the logical reality. As like when the player holds the breath control
              long time, heartbeat will be stronger than usual, HP bar will be minus, the heartbeat can be easy to recognize because the project makes it red full the screen.
              Or if the player pass the food or drinks but do not consume it, Han will be hungry and thirsty, as a  result, HP bar will be down until it is eaten something.
              The stamina is also be impacted if Han keeps running all the time. This feature makes the players calculate more on how to play Han logically.
              Every game has different features to attract the players. Hopefully, my the description can reach out to all your hearts and curiosity to enjoy this game.
              Lastly, it is a free to play game.
      </p>
      <p>
              <h2 style="color: blue">Tools and Technologies</h2><br>
              As I mentioned above, even an amateur is able to make it, because tools and technologies which support this game, are very common
              and easy to use. Especially, all its features that you need to use is are all free. Those applications called Unity, Photoshop
              and FMOD. Those use for particular features to support it. I am going to use Photoshop to create characters and the landscape
              of the game. Then, I will apply FMOD to get the audio clearer and more solid. For any game, this application is highly recommended.
              Because it has tutorials for beginners and it also has three different levels supporting different users, amateur, intermediate and then advanced.
              Lastly, whenever, everything is all setup, using Unity to get it all together to make the whole 2D or 3D games, in this case, it is 2D.
      </p>
      <p>
              <h2 style="color: blue">Skills Required</h2><br>
              As I mentioned above, this game/project is the Indie game which is the type of game that only one person can make it
              without anyone to help. However, that person needs at least some skills in basics to let the work easier and faster.
              In this game, specifically, does not have to be an expert. It needs a programmer who knows to write code, one who knows
              to create graphics and design it, a designer. A content creator to create the wonderful or at least meaningful story
              through the game. Lastly, the one who can search approriate music for game or compose music. In this case, the game does
              not need to be perfect in using any software, if they know the basics, it takes long time than usual.
      </p>
      <p>
              <h2 style="color: blue">Outcome</h2><br>
              If this project could be made in the future and fortunately, it is successful in the market that means my project can make money.
              Then, I can reach my thoughts to everyone. Importantly, I have something to interest all the company about the game I have made
              and it is not just made, it is played by many people. Moreover, for those who interested in this game will understand how hard
              and misereble dogs are whenever they lost their boss. This will make people love their dogs and more careful than before.
              This also means that the society or just a small community who played this game will be more careful in protecting their dogs from bad people.
              Moreover, for the developers, part one is successful which means part two is going to be in process. It is a good point.
